#### Background ####
We have data from four river sites Quebrada Cuenca 1-3 (q1, q2, q3) and Rio Mameyes Puente Roto (mpr). We are trying to recreate this figure from 


#### Data ####
First I read in the csv's ad well as immediately clean the names and filter for the columns (nutrients) figure 3 focused on. 

```{r}
q1dat <- read_csv(here::here("data","QuebradaCuenca1-Bisley.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(c("sample_id", "sample_date", "k","nh4_n","no3_n","mg","ca")) 

q2dat <- read_csv(here::here("data","QuebradaCuenca2-Bisley.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(c("sample_id", "sample_date", "k","nh4_n","no3_n","mg","ca")) 

q3dat <- read_csv(here::here("data","QuebradaCuenca3-Bisley.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(c("sample_id", "sample_date", "k","nh4_n","no3_n","mg","ca")) 

mprdat <- read_csv(here::here("data","RioMameyesPuenteRoto.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(c("sample_id", "sample_date", "k","nh4_n","no3_n","mg","ca")) 
```
