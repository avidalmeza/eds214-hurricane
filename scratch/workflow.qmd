AND im looking at 4 variables

1.  K (potassium)
2.  NO3 (nitrate)
3.  Mg (magnesium)
4.  Ca (calcium)
5.  NH4 (amonia)

for graphing i would like to : 1. Isolate variables 2. Merge data 3. clean the data remembering "9-wk moving averages" - dates -\> 1988 - 1994 - pivot for facet 4. Exploratory graphs 5. edit scales on facet

moving averages - A moving average is a statistical tool used to smooth out data over a set period by creating a constantly updated average. In finance, it helps traders and analysts identify trends by filtering out short-term fluctuations, or "noise," from a time series, like stock prices or sales figures.
