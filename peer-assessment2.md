Nice quarto doc! Entire thing runs.

No errors! Yay!

## [O] The analysis produces the expected output

I think so! Good job

Functions were refactored n stuff!

# Document

Has it! Has good citations and hwatnawt.

No flowchart but still a helpful-to-have readme!

So true so true.

Indeed it does.
