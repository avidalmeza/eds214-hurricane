#### Exceed Spec 

##At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
I believe I have exceeded this in two ways. The first is that I refactored two pieces of functionality into functions. The second is that my refactoring file has a roxygen skeleton, documenting what the functions need as imports and what the functions export. 

##The code is appropriately commented
When commenting code I try to make it so someone who has never looked at or heard of R can follow along with what I did. I believe this commenting makes it so I have exceeded this spec. 

####Collaboration 

My collaboration style is a sort of compliment sandwich. I like to make sure to balance good things with things that could be tweaked. In this way I felt like I was able to help Ixel continue working on her qmd. For example, Ixel had a large portion of her rolling average script in spaghetti, so i made note of this and added that once it goes into the qmd that it would work great because of her naming conventions. I also was able to collaborate with Ixel on her graph, which in turn gave me greater clarity on my own graph
